This is the NLP Project 
////////////////////////////////////////
Introduction
This project explores the task of generating abstracts for research papers using pre-trained transformers. The goal is to generate informative and concise summaries of research papers that can be used by researchers and academics to quickly identify relevant information and gain a deeper understanding of a paper's contribution.
////////////////////////////////////////
To install the project, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the arXiv dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the train.py script to train the model.
Run the generate.py script to generate abstracts for new research papers.
///////////////////////////////////////
Usage
Training the Model
To train the model, run the train.py script with the following command:
python train.py --data_dir path/to/data --output_dir path/to/output --model_name_or_path model_name --max_seq_length max_seq_length --num_train_epochs num_train_epochs --learning_rate learning_rate --per_gpu_train_batch_size per_gpu_train_batch_size --seed seed
data_dir: Path to the directory containing the arXiv dataset.
output_dir: Path to the directory where the trained model will be saved.
model_name_or_path: Pre-trained model to use for fine-tuning. Can be a path to a local directory or the name of a pre-trained model available in the Hugging Face Transformers library.
max_seq_length: Maximum length of input sequences.
num_train_epochs: Number of training epochs.
learning_rate: Learning rate for the Adam optimizer.
per_gpu_train_batch_size: Batch size for training. This value will be divided by the number of GPUs available on your machine.
seed: Random seed for reproducibility
//////////////////////////////////////
Generating Abstracts
To generate abstracts for new research papers, run the generate.py script with the following command:
python generate.py --model_path path/to/model --input_path path/to/input --output_path path/to/output --max_length max_length --num_beams num_beams

model_path: Path to the trained model.
input_path: Path to the file containing the research paper to summarize.
output_path: Path to the file where the generated abstract will be saved.
max_length: Maximum length of the generated abstract.
num_beams: Number of beams to use for beam search.
